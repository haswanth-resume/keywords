NginX:
Nginx is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy server that can also be used for load balancing, mail proxying, and HTTP caching.
Nginx is known for its speed and efficiency, making it a great choice for serving static content, as well as acting as a reverse proxy to distribute traffic to multiple servers.


Apache Tomcat:
Apache Tomcat is an open-source implementation of the Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Server Pages (JSP), and other Java technologies.
It serves as a Java servlet container, which means it can host Java-based web applications and manage Java servlets to process requests and generate responses efficiently
Tomcat is widely used for its robustness and scalability, making it a popular choice for developing and deploying dynamic web applications.

Webserver and Webservice:

Webserver:
Function: A web server is software designed to serve web pages to users. It handles HTTP requests from clients (like web browsers) and responds with HTML pages, images, and other resources.
Examples: Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft IIS.
Usage: Primarily used to host websites and deliver static content (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and dynamic content (via server-side scripts like PHP, ASP.NET).

Webservice:
A web service is an application that runs on a web server.
It results in a series of URLs that return data in a format intended to be parsed by a generic computer program (not just a browser).
Web services can use various data formats, such as XML, SOAP, or JSON (as long as both sides agree).
Unlike web pages, web services donâ€™t necessarily rely on the HTTP protocol; they can use other protocols too.
Web services serve structured data to calling programs, making them suitable for tasks beyond rendering HTML for browsers.

RabbitMQ:
RabbitMQ facilitates communication between different parts of a system by allowing them to exchange messages.
It acts as a middleman that ensures reliable delivery of messages from one component to another.

Mem cache is a database caching.

In Apllication.properties file:
#JDBC Configutation for Database Connection
#Memcached Configuration For Active and StandBy Host
#RabbitMq Configuration
#Elasticesearch Configuration


by using https Certificate for https encryption will be mentioned in ACM Amazon Certificate Manager Service.


architectural design of AWS:
ec2 instances
three separate security groups(security groups for load balancer, Tomcat and backend services)
Amazon Route 53 for DNS Private Zones (We will update IP to name mapping in Route 53)
S3 for storage (we upload our artifact to a s3 bucket From S3 bucket we will download our artifact to ec2 instance, where tomcat service will be running.)
elastic load balancer (Then we'll set up a load balancer with https connection,Will map our elastic load balancer and point to a website in GoDaddy DNS and will verify)
Amazon certificate manager and Route 53 service.
